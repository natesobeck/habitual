    <h1>About Habitual</h1>
    <p>We all have those things that we know we should be doing but we're not. Maybe you aren't flossing twice a day. Maybe you're not practicing your sport enough. Or maybe you want to pick up a new hobby but are finding it difficult to add to your routine. Whatever the case, we've got you. Here at Habitual, we can provide the accountability and tracking needed to make those activities automatic.</p>
